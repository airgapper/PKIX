# PKIX

The PacketFrame Internet Exchange is a free and open virtual IXP for network experimentation.


#### Connecting

To connect, first install ZeroTier for your router and join our ZeroTier network `ADD-NETWORK-ID-HERE`. Then send us an email at `noc@packetframe.com` with your ZeroTier ID and ASN. Configuration profiles are built automatically from PeeringDB, so please maintain an accurate profile containing your `AS-SET`. If everything matches up we'll provision your ZeroTier interface with your peering IPv6 address and PeeringDB information.

DO NOT try to assign any IPs to your ZeroTier interface. Our network controllers will take care of this for you so it is not necessary to assign any IP to your ZeroTier interface. Doing so will be rejected by the network and is only causes confusion.
